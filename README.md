Solarized (dark) Git Bash and VIM

This is how I solarize the Git Bash terminal and vim and change the font, prompt and title. 

# Installation
Add or make changes to the following files/folders:</br>
~/.bashrc</br>
~/.minttyrc</br>
~/.vimrc</br>
~/.dir_colors</br>
~/.vim/colors/solarized.vim</br>

If you clone this repo, make sure you do "ls -a" to see the hidden files.
